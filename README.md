### can betting on sports perform better than the S&P 500?

Partly inspired by Burton Malkiel's [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393330338) and the [Wall Street Goes To Vegas](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/01/06/508588660/episode-746-wall-street-goes-to-vegas) episode from the excellent Planet Money podcast.

Can a simple sports fan (me) beat "Wall Street" returns? We'll "invest" $100 dollars and follow the returns over the course of 6 months. I'll keep track here. If you have questions / issues, please create a GitHub Isses.
